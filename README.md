## Description

In this game, players take turns to roll a dice. The goal is to reach a score of 100 points or more. On each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as they wish, adding the dice roll to their current score. If a player rolls a 1, their turn ends, and they lose their current score. Players can choose to "hold" their score, adding it to their total score and passing the turn to the other player.

## How to Play

1. **Roll Dice**: Click the "Roll Dice" button to roll a dice.
2. **Hold Score**: Click the "Hold" button to add your current score to your total score.
3. **New Game**: Click the "New Game" button to reset scores and start a new game.
